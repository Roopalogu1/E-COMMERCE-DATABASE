TITLE: E-COMMERCE DATABASE WITH TKINTER(as its GUI)
OBJECTIVE: This project aims to create an interactive e-commerce user interface using the Tkinter library in Python. The interface will provide users with the ability to maintain the inventory of an e-commerce organization. The interface allows the user to view tables, Insert, Update, and Delete data from the database.
FEATURES OF THE CODE:
PYTHON: Programming language used for coding the project.
MYSQL: A database management system for executing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
TKINTER: Python’s standard GUI library for creating Graphical Interfaces. This project includes Labels, Entry box, Button. Grid() is used as its geometry manager to position the widgets on the root() window using the attributes – row and column.
Object Oriented Programming: OOP principles are used to structure the codebase and to create reusable components.
LIBRARIES/ PACKAGES: The “pymysql” package has to be installed before executing this program. This package has to be installed in the command prompt using the following command – pip install pymysql
WAYS TO “RUN” THIS PROGRAM:
1.	Command Line or Terminal:
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the .py file is located. Then, use the following command to run the script:
python E-COMMERCE DATABASE.py
2.	Integrated Development Environment(IDE):
If the user is using an IDE like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or IDLE, you can open the .py file in the IDE and click on the “Run” or “debug” button to execute the script.
3.	Python Interactive Shell: You can open the Python interactive shell (Python REPL) by typing "python" or "python3" in the command prompt or terminal. Once the interactive shell is open, you can use the "exec" function to run the contents of the .py file. For example:
Exec(open(“E-COMMERCE DATABASE.py”).read())
4.	Python Launcher (Windows): On Windows, if you have Python installed, you can use the Python Launcher to run .py files directly. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where the .py file is located. Then, use the following command to run the script:
Py E-COMMERCE DATABASE.py
5.	Batch Files or Shell scripts:
If you want to automate the execution of a .py file, you can create a batch file on Windows or a shell script on Unix-like systems (e.g., a Bash script).
These files allow you to specify the command to run the .py file along with any desired options or arguments.
